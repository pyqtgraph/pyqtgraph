  API / behavior changes:
    - Deprecated graphicsWindow classes; these have been unnecessary for many years because
      widgets can be placed into a new window just by calling show().
    - #158: Make DockArea compatible with Qt Designer
    - #406: Applying alpha mask on numpy.nan data values
    - #566: ArrowItem's `angle` option now rotates the arrow without affecting its coordinate system.
      The result is visually the same, but children of ArrowItem are no longer rotated
      (this allows screen-aligned text to be attached more easily).
      To mimic the old behavior, use ArrowItem.rotate() instead of the `angle` argument.
    - #673: Integer values in ParameterTree are now formatted as integer (%d) by default, rather than 
      scientific notation (%g). This can be overridden by providing `format={value:g}` when
      creating the parameter.
    - #374: ConsoleWidget uses the console's namespace as both global and local scope, which
    - #410: SpinBox siPrefix without suffix is not longer allowed, select only numerical portion of text on focus-in
      allows functions defined in the console to access the global namespace.
    - #479,521: ParameterTree simple parameters check types before setting value
    - #555: multiprocess using callSync='sync' no longer returns a future in case of timeout

      event position.
