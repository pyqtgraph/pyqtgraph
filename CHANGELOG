pyqtgraph-0.9.10

pyqtgraph-0.9.9

  API / behavior changes:
    - Dynamic import system abandoned; pg now uses static imports throughout.
        - Flowcharts and exporters have new pluggin systems
    - Version strings:
        - __init__.py in git repo now contains latest release version string
          (previously, only packaged releases had version strings).
        - installing from git checkout that does not correspond to a release 
          commit will result in a more descriptive version string.
    - Speed improvements in functions.makeARGB
    - ImageItem is faster by avoiding makeQImage(transpose=True)
    - ComboBox will raise error when adding multiple items of the same name
    - ArrowItem.setStyle now updates style options rather than replacing them 
    - Renamed GraphicsView signals to avoid collision with ViewBox signals that
      are wrapped in PlotWidget: sigRangeChanged => sigDeviceRangeChanged and
      sigTransformChanged => sigDeviceTransformChanged.
    - GLViewWidget.itemsAt() now measures y from top of widget to match mouse 
      event position.
    - Made setPen() methods consistent throughout the package

      (so you may need to adjust to lower alpha to achieve the same results)
