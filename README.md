A pure-Python graphics library for PyQt5/PyQt6/PySide2/PySide6

Copyright 2020 Luke Campagnola, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

<http://www.pyqtgraph.org>

PyQtGraph is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
Despite being written entirely in python, the library is fast due to its
heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching, Qt's GraphicsView framework for
2D display, and OpenGL for 3D display.

Requirements
------------

PyQtGraph has adopted [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html).

This project supports:

* All minor versions of Python released 42 months prior to the project, and at minimum the two latest minor versions.
* All minor versions of numpy released in the 24 months prior to the project, and at minimum the last three minor versions.
* All Qt5 versions from 5.12-5.15, and Qt6 6.1

Currently this means:

* Python 3.7+
* Qt 5.12-5.15, 6.1
* [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/),
  [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/),
  [PySide2](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python), or
  [PySide6](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python)
* [`numpy`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) 1.18+

### Optional added functionalities
