PyQtGraph
=========

A pure-Python graphics library for PyQt/PySide/PyQt5/PySide2

Copyright 2019 Luke Campagnola, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

<http://www.pyqtgraph.org>

PyQtGraph is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
Despite being written entirely in python, the library is fast due to its
heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching, Qt's GraphicsView framework for
2D display, and OpenGL for 3D display.

Requirements
------------

* PyQt 4.8+, PySide, PyQt5, or PySide2
* python 2.7, or 3.x
* Required
  * `numpy`, `scipy`
* Optional
  * `pyopengl` for 3D graphics
    * `pyqtgraph.opengl` will be depreciated in a future version and replaced with `VisPy`
  * `hdf5` for large hdf5 binary format support
* Known to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Qt Bindings Test Matrix
-----------------------

Below is a table of the configurations we test and have confidence pyqtgraph will work with.  All current operating major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) are tested against this configuration.  We recommend using the Qt 5.12 or 5.9 (either PyQt5 or PySide2) bindings.

| Python Version  |        PyQt4       | PySide             | PyQt5-5.6          | PySide2-5.6        | PyQt5-5.9          | PySide2-5.9        |      PyQt5-5.12    |  PySide2 5.12      |

* pyqtgraph has had some incompatabilities with PySide2-5.6, and we recommend you avoid those bindings if possible.
