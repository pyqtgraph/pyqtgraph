Installation Methods
--------------------

  * To use with a specific project, simply copy the pyqtgraph subdirectory
      anywhere that is importable from your project. PyQtGraph may also be
      used as a git subtree by cloning the git-core repository from github.
  * To install system-wide from source distribution:
        `$ python setup.py install`
  * For installation packages, see the website (pyqtgraph.org)
  * On debian-like systems, pyqtgraph requires the following packages:
        python-numpy, python-qt4 | python-pyside
        For 3D support: python-opengl, python-qt4-gl | python-pyside.qtopengl

Documentation
-------------

There are many examples; run `python -m pyqtgraph.examples` for a menu.

Some (incomplete) documentation exists at this time.
  * Easiest place to get documentation is at <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation>
  * If you acquired this code as a .tar.gz file from the website, then you can also look in
      doc/html.
  * If you acquired this code via GitHub, then you can build the documentation using sphinx.
      From the documentation directory, run:
          `$ make html`
  
Please feel free to pester Luke or post to the forum if you need a specific
  section of documentation to be expanded.
