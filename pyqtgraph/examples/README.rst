PyQtGraph comes packaged with a variety of examples demonstrating basic usage
of core components and features, full-fledged application demos, as well as
examples covering more advanced usage and customization.

There is also an application that provides an interface to run and edit the
example code. It can be invoked in several ways, but a simple method is to run
the ``examples`` module, assuming PyQtGraph has been installed::

    python -m pyqtgraph.examples
