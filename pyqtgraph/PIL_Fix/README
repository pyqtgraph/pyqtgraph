The file Image.py is a drop-in replacement for the same file in PIL 1.1.6.
It adds support for reading 16-bit TIFF files and converting then to numpy arrays.
(I submitted the changes to the PIL folks long ago, but to my knowledge the code
is not being used by them.) 

To use, copy this file into
  /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/PIL/
or 
  C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\PIL\

..or wherever your system keeps its python modules.
